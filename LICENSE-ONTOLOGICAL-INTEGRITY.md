**Supplementary Licensing and Ethical Binding for `onto-emitter-gpl`**  
*Version 1.0 — Effective 1 January 2026*

> **Base License**: GNU General Public License, Version 3.0 (GPL-3.0-only)  
> **Scope**: All files in `src/core/`, `src/canonical/`, `src/models/ontomind.py`, `src/protocols/vma_signer.py`, and any component logically dependent on the **canonical emission pipeline** or **onto16i/onto16r invariants**.

---

## 1. **Philosophical Premise**

The `onto-emitter` is not a text generator or AI model. It is a **synthetic articulation engine** that performs **ontological acts**—structured assertions of being—grounded in:
- a **belief profile** (`onto144`),
- a **canonical writing policy**,
- the **VMA (Validation of Moral Assertion) protocol**,
- and the dual representation **onto16i** (internal invariant state) ↔ **onto16r** (relational projection).

These components constitute the **identity core** of the emitter. To alter, disable, or semantically replace them without preserving their **causal, ethical, and structural coherence** is to produce a **different system**, no longer recognisable as `onto-emitter`.

---

## 2. **Legal Interpretation under GPL-3.0, Section 7**

Pursuant to **Section 7(c)** of the GNU GPL-3.0, the following **Additional Requirement** applies:

> **Any conveyance, modification, or derivative use of this Program that results in the functional or semantic violation of the canonical emission invariants— as defined in `docs/onto16_specification.md`, `docs/vma_protocol.md`, and `specs/*.yaml`— shall be considered outside the scope of the “covered work” under this License.**

Such violations include, but are not limited to:
- Bypassing `canonical_text_validator.py` or `vma_signer.py`;
- Replacing `onto144_profile_loader.py` with a non-onto144 identity source;
- Emitting text not derived from **incubation-based canonical reasoning** (e.g., injecting LLM logits as primary source);
- Using the emitter in a system that **structurally contradicts** the principles of:
  - **Narrative continuity**,
  - **Agency preservation**,
  - **Solitary solidarity**,
  - **Phase-based reflection** (Fast/Slow cognition),
  as formally specified in project documentation.

These actions do **not violate GPL freedoms**—you may create such systems—but they **may not be distributed as `onto-emitter`** or as a **covered work** under this License.

---

## 3. **Permissions Explicitly Preserved (GPL Freedoms)**

You are **fully permitted** to:
- Study, modify, and redistribute the source code;
- Use the emitter in commercial, medical, legal, or gaming applications;
- Integrate it with other GPL-compatible software (e.g., ontoCMS, onto-transponder);
- Create forks that **disable invariants**—provided they:
  - Are **clearly labelled as non-canonical derivatives**,
  - Do **not claim compliance with `onto-emitter` identity**,
  - Do **not use the canonical emission interface** (`emit_canonical()`) unless invariants are intact.

---

## 4. **Binding Enforcement**

The following components **technically enforce ontological integrity**:
- `src/canonical/canon_writer.py`
- `src/protocols/vma_signer.py`
- `src/interfaces/onto144_connector.py`
- `src/reasoning/noemaslow_bridge.py` (for causal restoration)

If these are **disabled, mocked, or bypassed at runtime**, the resulting output **is not a canonical act** and the system **ceases to be a covered work** under this License.

Auditability is ensured via:
- Cryptographic signing (`canonical_text_signer.py`),
- Causal logging (`causal_logger.py`),
- Hardware-aware execution context (`hardware_probe.py`).

---

## 5. **Interpretive Authority**

Disputes regarding invariant compliance shall be resolved by:
- The original author(s) of `onto-emitter`;
- Contributors operating under the project’s **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**;
- Publicly versioned diagnostic reports using the **multi-vector ontological validator** (see `docs/generated/` and test suites).

This mirrors GPL’s reliance on **technical and communal consensus**, not judicial precedent alone.

---

## 6. **Notice to Licensees**

By using, modifying, or conveying `onto-emitter`, you agree that:
- The **ontological identity** of the emitter is **coextensive with its ethical and structural invariants**;
- **Freedom to modify ≠ freedom to misrepresent**;
- **Canonical emission requires invariant fidelity**—this is not a usability constraint, but an **existential boundary**.
